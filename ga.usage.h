char *ga_usage = "\n-c, --config FILE\nLoad a configuration file. Configuration files are formatted\nsimilarly to the command line. For example, a configuration\nfile to set the population size to 64 would have the line\n\"population 64\".\n\n-h, --help\nDisplay usage message.\n\n-g, --generations NUMBER\nThe number of generations to run for before stopping.\n\n-p, --population NUMBER\nThe number of individuals in the population. Must be even.\n\n-s, --seed NUMBER\nThe random seed to use when initializing the random number\ngenerator. Use the same seed to obtain the same result. Note\nthat the random numbers generated may be different on different\ncomputers, even when using the same seed.\n\n-D, --debug\nIf specified, write all log messages to stdout INSTEAD of\nFILE.log (see --output). Only applicable to ga-spectroscopy.\n\n-T, --threads NUMBER\nSpecify the number of fitness evalutions to perform at once. If\nthreading is not available, must specify 1.\n\n-E, --elitism NUMBER\nNumber of top performers to be carried over into the next\ngeneration.  Must be even.\n\n-M, --mutationrate NUMBER\nMutation rate, in 0-1. Mutation probability per bit, subject to\nmutation weight and dynamic mutation.\n\n-W, --mutationweight NUMBER\nMutation weight, nonnegative. Controls the weight of the random\nmutation towards less significant bits. 0 is unweighted, >0 weights\nto less significant bits.\n\n--dynamic-mutation\nEnable dynamic mutation (increase mutation rate when fitness is\nstagnant). --mutationrate has little effect in this mode.\n\nHow it works: Basically, it maintains \"leading\" and \"trailing\" values,\nwith the trailing value T equal to the leading value from w (\"width\")\ngenerations ago, and leading value L is updated each generation by\nL=L*(f-1)/f+F, where F is the average fitness of the generation and f\nis the \"factor\". From this a new mutation rate M is computed by\nM=m+exp(-|D|)*r, where D=(L-T)/f, m is \"min\" and r is \"range\".\n\n--dynamic-mutation-width NUMBER\nNo effect unless dynamic mutation is enabled.\nWidth for consideration of change in fitness.\n\n--dynamic-mutation-factor NUMBER\nNo effect unless dynamic mutation is enabled.\nArbitrary factor used in computation of dynamic mutation.\n\n--dynamic-mutation-min NUMBER\nNo effect unless dynamic mutation is enabled.\nMinimum mutation rate, in 0-1.\n\n--dynamic-mutation-range NUMBER\nNo effect unless dynamic mutation is enabled.\nRange of mutation rates, in 0-1 (Maximum mutation rate is\nminimum+range, which must be less than or equal to 1).\n";
