char *ga_usage = "\n-c, --config FILE\nLoad a configuration file. Configuration files are formatted\nsimilarly to the command line. For example, a configuration\nfile to set the population size to 64 would have the line\n\"population 64\".\n\n-h, --help\nDisplay usage message.\n\n-g, --generations NUMBER\nThe number of generations to run for before stopping.\n\n-p, --population NUMBER\nThe number of individuals in the population. Must be even.\n\n-s, --seed NUMBER\nThe random seed to use when initializing the random number\ngenerator. Use the same seed to obtain the same result. Note\nthat the random numbers generated may be different on different\ncomputers, even when using the same seed.\n\n-D, --debug\nIf specified, write all log messages to stdout INSTEAD of\nFILE.log (see --output). Only applicable to ga-spectroscopy.\n\n-T, --threads NUMBER\nSpecify the number of fitness evalutions to perform at once. If\nthreading is not available, must specify 1.\n\n-E, --elitism NUMBER\nNumber of top performers to be carried over into the next\ngeneration.  Must be even.\n\n-M, --mutationrate NUMBER\nMutation rate, in 0-1. Mutation probability per segment per two\nindividuals. Each of the two individuals has 2/3 probability of\nhaving a mutation. Bit position for the two mutations is the\nsame.\n\n-W, --mutationweight NUMBER\nMutation weight, nonnegative. Controls the weight of the random\nmutation towards less significant bits. >1 weights to less\nsignificant bits, <1 weights to more significant bits, 1 is\nunweighted.\n";
